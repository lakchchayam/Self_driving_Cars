# Self_driving_Cars
Today, the machine learning algorithms are extensively used to find the solutions to various challenges arising in manufacturing self-driving cars. With the incorporation of sensor data processing in an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) in a car, it is essential to enhance the utilization of machine learning to accomplish new tasks. The potential applications include evaluation of driver condition or driving scenario classification through data fusion from different external and internal sensors – like lidar, radars, cameras or the IoT (Internet of Things).

The applications that run the infotainment system of a car can receive the information from sensor data fusion systems and for example, have the capability to direct the car to a hospital if it notices that something is not right with the driver. This application based on machine learning also includes the driver’s speech and gesture recognition and language translation. The algorithms are classified as an unsupervised and supervised algorithms. The difference between both of them is how they learn.
An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does.
